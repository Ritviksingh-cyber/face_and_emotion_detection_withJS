- Face recognition: The application can recognize faces based on pre-trained models.
- Emotion recognition: The application can recognize emotions such as happiness, sadness, and anger.
- Face landmarks detection: The application can detect facial landmarks such as eyes, nose, and mouth.

## Technologies

This application uses the following technologies:

- JavaScript: The programming language used to develop the application.
- face-api.js: A JavaScript library for face detection, recognition, and analysis.
- HTML/CSS: The markup and styling languages used to create the user interface.
